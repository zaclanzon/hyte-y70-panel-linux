# hyte-panel

A dashboard for the **HYTE Y70 Touch** case screen, for any Linux desktop. Clock, weather,
CPU, GPU, memory, network, fan speeds, your AI coding agents, and a cellular
automata playground you can paint on. Colors follow your case lighting.

## How it works

The panel is a small web app that runs on your PC.

- A Python server (FastAPI) reads the hardware once a second and serves one
  page. It listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` only.
- A kiosk window shows that page full screen on the HYTE screen. It is a GTK4
  window with WebKit inside, so touch works like on a phone.
- The same page opens in any browser on the PC. `http://127.0.0.1:8787/` is
  the panel, `http://127.0.0.1:8787/settings` is the settings page, and
  `/api/...` returns the data as JSON.
- Everything runs as a systemd user service and shows up as **HYTE Panel** in
  the app grid. No build step, no API keys, one Python venv.

## Install

Any Linux distribution with a desktop session. Python 3.11+. NVIDIA driver for
GPU data. The installer knows the package names for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora,
Arch, openSUSE, Alpine and Void; on anything else it tells you what to install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zaclanzon/hyte-y70-panel-linux.git ~/src/hyte-y70-panel
cd ~/src/hyte-y70-panel
scripts/install.sh        # system packages (sudo once), a venv, config, app grid entry, autostart
```

Then rotate the HYTE screen to portrait in your display settings, run
`scripts/map-touch.sh` so touches land on it, and open **HYTE Panel** from
the app grid and press Start.

Prefer pipx? The system packages for GTK4, WebKitGTK and PyGObject still come
from your distro (see the installer for names), then:

```bash
pipx install --system-site-packages "hyte-panel[nvidia] @ git+https://github.com/zaclanzon/hyte-y70-panel-linux.git"
hyte-panel setup          # config, app grid entry, systemd user unit or autostart entry, environment check
```

With systemd the panel runs as a user service; without it, an XDG autostart
entry starts it at login. The step-by-step checklist is in
[docs/install.md](docs/install.md), screen and driver notes in
[docs/hyte-y70-ubuntu.md](docs/hyte-y70-ubuntu.md).

Update later:

```bash
cd ~/src/hyte-y70-panel && git pull
~/.local/share/hyte-panel/venv/bin/pip install --quiet ".[nvidia]"
systemctl --user restart hyte-panel      # or: hyte-panel run
```

## Use it

**Control window.** Open **HYTE Panel** from the app grid: running or not,
Start / Stop / Restart, Settings, Open in browser, recent log. Right-click the
icon for Settings, Start and Stop.

**Choose your widgets.** Tap the sliders icon at the bottom of the panel. Every
card gets up, down and hide buttons; hidden ones wait in a tray at the bottom.
Or open Settings, in the control window or at `http://127.0.0.1:8787/settings`,
to toggle and reorder widgets and change each one's options: weather location
with a place search, disks, agent process names, the automata rule, app
buttons, and where the colors come from. Changes apply immediately.

**Colors.** Two accent colors drive the whole page. By default they come from
your case lighting through an [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org) server, or from a
JSON file your lighting tool writes. Without either, pick a preset or two
colors in Settings. The animated ground behind the cards is chosen there too,
from forty-four live previews: liquid metal, aero ribbons, bokeh, pool
caustics, ink marble, satin, reaction-diffusion coral, lava lamp, light shafts,
contour lines, a hex lattice, aurora curtains, a nebula, plasma, stained cells,
rain on glass, a neon horizon, smoke, circuit traces, a star warp, an ocean
swell, a wormhole, a night skyline, a sonar sweep, code rain, a black hole,
fireflies, a double helix, a failing CRT, flames, a storm, a spiral galaxy,
wireframe terrain, a ringed planet, pond ripples, a hologram globe, lasers,
moonlit dunes, a meteor shower, glitch bands, an oscilloscope, a comet, a pulsar and a solar eclipse.
Visible settings tiles animate automatically at 15 fps using one shared WebGL
context and a combined 96,000-pixel budget. Offscreen tiles and hidden tabs stop
rendering; the panel background is capped at 30 fps. Saving or reloading settings
keeps the existing preview canvases and compiled shaders, so thumbnails do not
restart in a slow sequence.

**Automata.** The card runs Life-like rules, Brian's Brain, Wolfram's
elementary rules and cyclic automata on the GPU. Drag to paint, hold to stamp
a pattern, tap the rule name to pick another. Left alone it rotates rules, and
CPU load, network traffic and agent activity feed the world. The cells have
their own three colors, set on a wheel in Settings. Details in
[automata/README.md](automata/README.md).

**AI agents.** The card lists running agent CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Aider,
Gemini, and more). For live status from Claude Code, copy the `hooks` block
from [examples/claude-code-hooks.json](examples/claude-code-hooks.json) into
`~/.claude/settings.json`. Any script can post a status:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/agents/status \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"id":"nightly","name":"Nightly build","status":"working","detail":"Compiling"}'
```

## Configure by hand

Settings are stored in `~/.config/hyte-panel/config.toml`. The settings page
writes the same file, so editing by hand is optional. See
[config.example.toml](config.example.toml) for every key with comments. The
ones the settings page does not cover, read at start only:

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server.host`, `server.port` | Keep the host at `127.0.0.1`: the page can launch programs. |
| `display.width`, `display.height` | Screen size. Y70 Touch: 720 x 2560. Infinite: 1100 x 3840. |
| `display.connector` | Force a monitor, for example `"DP-3"`. Empty = match by size. |
| `display.backend` | `auto`, `gtk`, or `chromium` as a fallback kiosk. |

## API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/snapshot` | One reading of all hardware, weather, agents and theme. |
| GET | `/api/config` | Public config: layout, apps, display, weather label. |
| GET, PUT | `/api/settings` | Read or save the config. Saving reloads live. Same-origin only. |
| GET | `/api/theme` | Accent colors and their source. |
| GET | `/api/agents` | Agent list. |
| POST | `/api/agents/hook` | Claude Code hook payload. |
| POST | `/api/agents/status` | Generic status: `{id, name, status, detail}`. |
| POST | `/api/launch/{index}` | Start app button `index`. |
| WS | `/ws` | Push stream of `config`, `snapshot` and `agent` messages. |

## Develop

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[nvidia,dev]"
.venv/bin/hyte-panel serve       # server only; open http://127.0.0.1:8787 in a browser
.venv/bin/hyte-panel run         # server + kiosk window
.venv/bin/pytest
```

Use the browser's device toolbar at 682 x 2560 to see the portrait layout.
Front end is plain HTML, CSS and JS in `hyte_panel/static/`; the automata
module is `hyte_panel/static/ca/` with its own tests in `automata/`.
